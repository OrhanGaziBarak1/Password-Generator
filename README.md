# Password Generator
- User is able to generate a strong password for your accounts and user can copy them to clipboard then use it in everywhere.

## Cons
- If user wouldn't type password's length app is crashing so, password length must not be null.
- If user select every checkBox elements not checked app is crashing again so, password's content must not be null too.
